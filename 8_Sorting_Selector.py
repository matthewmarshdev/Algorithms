#import methods

#start off with declaration of variables

#method to try to change a list into a set, tuple

#instantiate the UI with pop-up, loading input window
#add help language in the UI

#ask user to input a series of numbers (can be 3 numbers or up to 10000)
#Click a run method in the UI

#Add list variable from input into method 1 (Selection Sort)
#output should be a sorted list and time from start to finish

#Add list variable from input into method 1 (Shell Sort)
#output should be a sorted list and time from start to finish

#Add list variable from input into method 1 (Quick Sort)
#output should be a sorted list and time from start to finish

#put all 3 method outputs in a table with the following columns:
#Sort Algorithm Name, Original List, Sorted List, Time to Sort, Time Variable

#Render the Table in the UI
#Render a new button in the UI: Clear Table
#Render a new button in the UI: See Logs
#Render a new button in the UI: Ask GPT?

#If user clicks Clear Table, reset list variable, derender table, wipe API response
#If user clicks See Logs, open file that shows each iteration performed in each method
#If user clicks Ask GPT, use OpenAI API to send following Prompt:
#"What sorting algorithm would be best to use to sort the following list:" + ListVar
#Display and render response from API
